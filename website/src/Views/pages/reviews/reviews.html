          <h4>Fantastic vibe, service, staff, and food.</h4>
          <p>
            My brother and I have been following Lancaster's on social media for
            some time and finally decided to take a visit with our partners. The
            restaurant has a great vibe and watching the chefs (or should I say
            artists) at work is just something else.
          </p>
          <p>
            What makes for amazing service: Offering drinks when they can see
            our drinks were running low. All without being asked. Table wiped
            between courses. Friendly, happy staff. Just great.
          </p>
          <p>
            The food was 10/10, and my husband says it's the best burger he's
            ever had!

          <h4>Stunning food</h4>
          <p>
            I was slightly worried that it wouldn't live up to expectations but
            it was genuinely one of the best meals I've had all year. Some of
            the most flavoursome, lip-smacking, finger-licking food I've ever
            eaten.
          </p>
          <p>
            I could eat those corn ribs every day for the rest of my life and
            never get bored. Absolutely adored this place and will definitely
            return when I'm next in London.

          <p>
            Had a great dinner here during our trip to London from the States.
            Highly recommend the mushroom parfait, ribs, and strawberry custard
            cream. The mussels and burger were also very good. Server was
            attentive and had great knowledge of the menu.

            Exceptional food combined with wonderful service - the mushroom
            parfait and the beef ribs were sensational. Can't wait to return!

          <h4>Nice food but cramped and erratic dining experience</h4>
          <p>
            Came for lunch, enjoyed the corn ribs and mushroom parfait to start,
            then we had pork roast. The vegetables, roasties and meat could not
            be faulted. The negative bit was the service, we had to chase our
            drinks(3 times) and our server was a little erratic and rushed.
          </p>
          <p>
            A very busy place, luckily we were three and were given a table for
            four. It was a little tight for couples who appeared “crammed “ on
            small tables for two that were close together.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nice food but a hectic and confined eating experience. Also question
            people being allowed to bring dogs into the restaurant, also
            allowing it to feed there.
